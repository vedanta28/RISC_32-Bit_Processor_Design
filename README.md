[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

In this project, we have implemented a typical RISC-32 Processor having a 5-stage pipeline. The project is built on [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). Kindly refer to Download section in the README.md file of the linked github page for help in installing the software.

## Features

- Implemented a 5-stage RISC 32-bit pipeline, supporting 32-bit intructions and data.
- Implemented a Register File with 32 registers with each register of size 32 bits.
- Implemented the memory with 64 locations each of size 32 bits, and the address line of size 6 bits. Each memory location contains either an 32-bit instrucion or a 32-bit data. This can be easily extented to allow for much larger sizes of memory.
- Intructions supported: MOV, MVI, LOAD, STORE, ADD, ADI, SUB, SUI, AND, ANI, OR, ORI, HLT
- Support for branched and call instructions might be added in future.

## Contents of the File

The repository **MIPS_32-Bit_Processor_Design** contains the following files:

- **_Encoding Scheme.pdf_**: This file contains the basic encoding scheme of our instructions and also contains a dry run of an example program with clear steps.
- **_Implementation\_Block Level Diagrams.pdf_**: This file contains the block level implementation of the circuit, and also explains the implementation in great detail.
- **_CPU\_Design.circ_**: This file contains the circuit which is built on Logisim-evolution

## Softwares used

- logisim-evolution (Version-3.8.0)
- LaTeX (Live Version 2022)# RISC 32-bit Processor Design
